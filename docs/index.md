Welcome to the central repository for Foodhub's system design and architecture documentation. This site serves as a living document, providing detailed insights into the architecture, design principles, and operational procedures of our various systems.

## Existing Documentation

This repository currently hosts the following system design documents:

### Applications

- **[Foodhub Web Application](./categories/applications/foodhub_web/):** This document outlines the architecture of the main Foodhub web application, including its components, services, and data flows.

### CI/CD Pipelines

- **[Foodhub Web CI/CD Pipeline](./categories/CI%5CCD-pipeline/foodhub_web/):** This document details the continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for the Foodhub web application, covering everything from code commit to production deployment.

## Future Expansion

This documentation is continuously evolving. We encourage contributions and plan to expand the repository to include a wider range of system designs. Future additions could include:

- **Mobile Application Architecture:** Detailed design of our iOS and Android applications.
- **Microservices Architecture:** In-depth documentation for each of our backend microservices.
- **Data Engineering Pipelines:** Designs for our data ingestion, processing, and storage pipelines.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Documentation for our Terraform or CloudFormation scripts.
- **Security Architecture:** An overview of our security principles and implementation details.
- **Disaster Recovery Plans:** Detailed plans for ensuring business continuity in case of a disaster.

We welcome contributions from all teams. If you have a system design to document, please follow the existing structure and create a new subdirectory within the appropriate category.
